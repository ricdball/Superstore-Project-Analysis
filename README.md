# Superstore Project Analysis
An analysis aiming to analyze company revenue while forecasting the following year revenue goals. The analysis will analyze historical data on revenue, regional market performance, consumer segments, and product categories to provide insight and recommendations to increase future sales and profits through viable marketing strategies, and insights to better understand customer segments and their buying behaviors to increase consumer engagement.

2) Is revenue driven in a specific market region(s)? Which regions have yielded to be the highest and lowest performing markets? Which regions based on performance appear to be the primary market base?
3) What customers drive the company's profits?
4) Which products see less shelf time and more turnover for more revenue?
